## Not the best tutorial
* Business logic is not sperated good enough. Cookies rather in the context of react
* Fking code is way to long split it up buddy
* The naming is not the best but that is something personal

## Things I can use in this tutorial:
* React Forms hooks (use Form)
* Tailwind apply globals
* Auth and the sessions maybe
* Whenever buying this but not register ask user to register with redirect to shipping like `/register?redirect=login`
